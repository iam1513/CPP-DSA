/*
    @ WHY OOPS?
    
    * Procedure Oriented Progamming was used before OOPS
        - conventional programming paradigm , use high level lang - C,COBOL,FORTRAN
        - program was divided into tasks and group into function
        - main focus was on fuctions
        - global data instead of local

        >Demerits
        -difficult to track which function changed data
        -if data struc is changed, functions are to revised

    THAT IS WHY OOPS!
        - main focus was on data
        - we bind data to the fuction using it
        - programs are divided into objects and each have it own data and functions
        - protects data from accidental changes

/*
    @ WHAT IS A CLASS?
        - fundamental unit of OOP
        - user defined data types
        - define some data/propt and methods/functions for the class

        //if we want to define apples , mangoes, grapes 
        we can make , class fruit and will have propt like color ,taste

        class is fruit and mango,apple,etc fruits are objects
*/

/*
    @WHAT ARE OBJECTS?
        - variables of a class
        - have all propts that are defined in class
