    @ ABSTRACTION
    - enables us to display only essential information while hiding implementation details

/*
    @ INHERITANCE
    - a class inherits properties of another class
    - use dfor cod e re-usablity

    (parent/super class) --->INHERITED TO --->(child/sub class)

    ex: parent class ===> vehicle with propt tyres and capacity
        child class ===> truck , car, bike ---> all will inherit propt from parent class as they are same 


    - access specifier & modes of inh:
        - public ===> can be accessed from anywhere in the code
        - private ===> accessible only in own class
        - protected ===> accessible in own class , parent class & derived class

    - types of inheritance
        - single inhertance ===> properties directy inherited
        - multi level inheritance ===> parent class is derived from another class 
        - multiple inheritance ===> child class is inherited from multiple parent classes
        - hierarchical inheritance ===> single prent class and multiple child classes
        - hyybrid inheritance ===> combination of more than one inheritance type
