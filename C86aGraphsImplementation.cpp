// APP 1 : ADJACENCY LIST
// In this app with represent graphs as a array of LL

// APP 2 : ADJACENCY MAP
// Here we represent graphs in the form of hashmap/unordered map

// APP 3 : ADJACENCY MATRIX
// In this app, we represent a graph in 2D array or Matrix of VxV dimentions where V is th no. of vertices.

// APP 4 : INCIDENCE MATRIX
// In this app, we prepare a VxV matrix where V is the no. of vertices and e is no. of edges
